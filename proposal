# Project Proposal

For my class project, I would like to create a script to handle much of the data analysis that I perform on routine projects. 
These projects include vaccine effacy studies which may or may not have genetic sequence data associated with it. 
When genetic sequence data is present 
## Main Question:

### Background information

### First steps:
  
### Questions I want to answer with these analyses

### The code

I have previously used R for the majority of my data analysis and table/figure generation. I may stick with R, or use a combination of R and python where necessary.
