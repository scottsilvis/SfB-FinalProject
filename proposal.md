# Project Proposal

For my class project, I would like to create a script to handle much of the data analysis that I perform on routine projects. These projects primarily consist of vaccine effacy studies which may or may not have genetic sequence data associated with it. 

I would like to have the ability to run power analyses, with the scripts handling the majority of the work and only the bare minimum input from me being required. 

Antibody data will generally be present. I would like to be able to give a dataframe or excel document and have the function automatically caculate the geometic mean from the data I provide. From there I would need functionalty to run the basic tests we typically perform (ANOVA, Repeated Measures ANOVA, Mann Whitney U, etc). Again I would like our typical option selection to be already input so I only need to give the bare minimun. 

When genetic sequence data is present I would like to have the ability to run a MAAFT alignment (if RNA or DNA) or Clustal alignment (if protein), and create an RAxML tree following procedures for each sequence type. 

Occasionally we will analyze the sequence data or antibody data with PCA. Having that functionality available, but in a more versitile form would be nice (more options available to modify). 

Lastly, having a simplified way of producing the common tables and figures would be great. 

## Main Question:

### Background information

### First steps:
  
### Questions I want to answer with these analyses

### The code

I have previously used R for the majority of my data analysis and table/figure generation. I may stick with R, or use a combination of R and python where necessary.
